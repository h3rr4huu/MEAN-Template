# MEAN Template App #

(Node.js, AngularJS, Express.js, SASS, Bootstrap 3 and Gulp. MongoDB set up not included.)  

This is a template app for easy MEAN-stack development. A complete gulpfile is also included for building JavaScripts and SASS-files.

## Requirements ##

* Node.js 0.10.33+

Older versions should also work just fine, but are not tested.

## Getting started ##

First install the requirements and then run the following commands to get started:

```
npm install
bower install
npm start
```

Bower install should automatically be run after "npm install", but you may run it manually also. After running "npm start" the server should be listening at http://localhost:3000
